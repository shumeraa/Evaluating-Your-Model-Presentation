On July 10th, I delivered a presentation on evaluating machine learning models to students at the NLP Logix summer data science bootcamp. In this presentation, I covered key topics including Mean Squared Error (MSE), confusion matrices, precision and recall, ROC curves, and more. You can access my slides and materials in the repository.

To run the example code, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    - On Windows:
    ```bash
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    - On Linux:
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. **Install the Required Packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
